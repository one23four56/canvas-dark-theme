# canvas-dark-theme
A chrome extension that gives canvas a dark theme.  
I was bored over the weekend so I made this. ~~I am probably not going to update it, so if you want something feel free to add it yourself.~~ I am working on adding a few more themes to choose from. You can still add something yourself if you want it.

## How to install: 

Unfortunately, it costs 1 dollar to put extensions on the Chrome Web Store, and I do not have a dollar currently available. Because of this, you will have to download this extension the manual way, instructions for which are below. 

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome
3. Click the three dots > More Tools > Extensions
4. Turn Developer Mode on and click 'Load unpacked'
5. Select the cloned repositoy and click 'Select Folder'
6. Done!
